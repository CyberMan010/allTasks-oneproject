# React Redux Project with Chat, Form, and Task Management 3 in 1 !

## This project is a React-based application that integrates three key features:
1. **Chat System**: A simulated chat interface with message sending and typing indicators.
2. **Form Handling**: A customizable form with validation and state management.
3. **Task Management**: A task management system for adding and removing tasks.

__The project uses **Redux Toolkit** for state management and **React Router** for navigation between features.__

View tasks in a list.
Remove tasks by clicking the delete button next to each task.
Redux State Management
Store Configuration
The project uses a single Redux store with the following slices:

Chat Slice (chatSlice.js):
Manages chat messages, typing user, and active users.
Form Slice (formSlice.js):
Manages form data, validation errors, and form submission state.
Task Slice (taskSlice.js):
Manages tasks (add/remove).
Example Store Configuration

import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import chatReducer from './slices/chatSlice';
import formReducer from './slices/formSlice';
import taskReducer from './slices/taskSlice';

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    chat: chatReducer,
    form: formReducer,
    tasks: taskReducer,
  },
});
